Blocklab and OVSoftware, the initiators of this project are interested in seeing whether or not the blockchain framework Substrate can be used as a viable SDK for the development of projects like the one proposed in this document- namely a decentralised auctioning system. The resulting application will answer this question. The scope of this project can be divided into two subsequent ones- namely the development and research scope. The development scope goes as far as an auctioning system on which time-slots can be browsed, selected, offered and bid on. The research scope will encapsulate topics related to the technologies itself like the Rust programming language and the theory behind blockchains. Some prelimenary research will also be done to build some understanding regarding
